As we navigate the digital world, AI tools have become crucial in aiding productivity and efficiency. DocAssistant Enterprise is a system that has evolved from the foundation of DocAssistant to not only work with individual documents but handle a multitude of them across any organization.  
   
DocAssistant Enterprise is designed to revolutionize your document management systems. It allows a seamless transition between various access levels within a company, making data retrieval a hassle-free experience for all users. Whether you're a business analyst needing developer-level data or a CEO requiring an overview of all documents, our system has got you covered.  
   
This advanced system ensures high-level security by granting access to specific data to authorized personnel only. It proficiently manages denied document requests, maintaining stringent security measures while offering a user-friendly document management interface.  
   
The system offers an intuitive and dynamic interface that can be customized to your preference. It facilitates the creation of new user accounts, management of document permissions, and batch uploading of documents.  
   
The AI in DocAssistant Enterprise is powered by Azure Search Indexing and Open AI's ada model. It intelligently divides documents into manageable parts, collecting key details and feeding them into the Azure Search Index. Through smart prompt integration and orchestration of GPT chat models, our system serves as a co-pilot to aid employees in interacting with company data.  
   
With DocAssistant Enterprise, online safety is a top priority. It allows you to focus on your offline security while it takes care of your online document management.  
   
This project was made possible thanks to the combined efforts of our developers, business analysts, and testers, who worked tirelessly to deliver a product that truly revolutionizes document management. Thanks to Microsoft cognitive services Azure Open AI service, Azure Form Recognizer, and Azure Bot, we have been able to create a product that stands above the rest.  

## Future Development Features of DocAssistant Enterprise  
   
As DocAssistant Enterprise continues to evolve and adapt to the ever-changing demands of the digital landscape, we are excited to announce a few features that we plan to develop in the future to enhance user experience and functionality:  
   
1. **SharePoint Documentation Interaction:** We aim to integrate a feature that will allow users to engage in chats about different sections of SharePoint Documentation. This will enable users to have interactive discussions, share insights, and clarify doubts about SharePoint Documentation, fostering a collaborative environment.  
   
2. **Confluence Support:** Acknowledging the widespread use of Confluence in managing project documentation, we plan to extend our support to this platform. This feature will allow users to integrate their Confluence documentation with DocAssistant Enterprise, enhancing accessibility and efficiency.  
   
3. **Azure DevOps Ticket Interaction:** We plan to implement a feature that allows users to chat about tickets in Azure DevOps. This will facilitate real-time discussions about ongoing tasks, issues, or bugs, leading to quicker resolution and streamlined workflow.

4. **GitHub Markdown Files Support:** Recognizing the widespread use of GitHub for project development and management, we plan to extend our support to GitHub Markdown files. Users will be able to integrate their GitHub repositories with DocAssistant Enterprise, facilitating seamless interaction with project documentation stored as Markdown files.  
   
5. **Support for Various Document Formats:** To make DocAssistant Enterprise a truly versatile tool, we plan to expand our support to various document formats without any limitations. This means users will be able to upload, access, and interact with documents regardless of their format, further simplifying document management and ensuring a more inclusive user experience.  
   
These planned features aim to make DocAssistant Enterprise an even more comprehensive tool for document access, catering to a wider array of user needs and preferences. We look forward to rolling out these updates in the future!
