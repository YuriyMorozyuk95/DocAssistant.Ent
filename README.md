# DocAssistant Enterprise  
## Revolutionizing Document Management Systems  
   
As we navigate the digital world, AI tools have become crucial in aiding productivity and efficiency. DocAssistant Enterprise is a system that has evolved from the foundation of DocAssistant to not only work with individual documents but handle a multitude of them across any organization.  
   
DocAssistant Enterprise is designed to revolutionize your document management systems. It allows a seamless transition between various access levels within a company, making data retrieval a hassle-free experience for all users. Whether you're a business analyst needing developer-level data or a CEO requiring an overview of all documents, our system has got you covered.  
   
This advanced system ensures high-level security by granting access to specific data to authorized personnel only. It proficiently manages denied document requests, maintaining stringent security measures while offering a user-friendly document management interface.  
   
The system offers an intuitive and dynamic interface that can be customized to your preference. It facilitates the creation of new user accounts, management of document permissions, and batch uploading of documents.  
   
The AI in DocAssistant Enterprise is powered by Azure Search Indexing and Open AI's ada model. It intelligently divides documents into manageable parts, collecting key details and feeding them into the Azure Search Index. Through smart prompt integration and orchestration of GPT chat models, our system serves as a co-pilot to aid employees in interacting with company data.  
   
With DocAssistant Enterprise, online safety is a top priority. It allows you to focus on your offline security while it takes care of your online document management.  
   
This project was made possible thanks to the combined efforts of our developers, business analysts, and testers, who worked tirelessly to deliver a product that truly revolutionizes document management. Thanks to Microsoft cognitive services Azure Open AI service, Azure Form Recognizer, and Azure Bot, we have been able to create a product that stands above the rest.
